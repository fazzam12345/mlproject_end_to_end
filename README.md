## End-to-end Machine Learning Project with deployment

This project is a simple end-to-end machine learning project that uses the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library to train a model on a dataset and then deploy it to a web service. The project includes a Dockerfile that can be used to build a Docker image for the project, and a Makefile that can be used to build and deploy the Docker image to a Docker container.
